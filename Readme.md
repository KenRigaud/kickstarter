The purpose of this analysis was to see correlation between outcomes vs goals and outcomes vs launch within the theaters categories.

## Analysis and Challenges: 
	Most of the analytical work came from bulding functions to automate most of the analysis given the sample size. A lot of the challenge was creating unique ways to best utilize the "=countifs()" function to best capture the ranges for the Outcomes based on Goals chart. The other key knowledge was the use of "$" to lock range references to enable the "double-click" feature to copy functions for all necessary criteria. Some skill also fell into knowing how to properly navigate tabs in excel to properly format the data for some elements of the chart. For example, the "Outcomes Based on Goals" chart required that the vertical axis be formatted as percents. The combination of both excel navigation and proper understanding of function use is what was most needed for these assignment. 

## Results: 
	Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.

## Conclusions Theater outcomes based on Goals:
	(1)	December Launch Dates have a surprisingly low success rate
	(2)	Summer has a high success rate

## Conclusions Outcomes based on Goals:
	(1) 	The highest outcomes percentage occurs with the smallest goal, which would make since as it gets 	    	exponentially harder to fulfill higher goals
			-This dataset seems is limited by the lack of information. Filtering by categories would 			make the data more robust and easier to pull data from.


## Other possible tables and/or graphs that would be of interest:
	A graph that pits backer count vs success since it would be interesting to see if amount of backers 	contribute to success.
